The work of the civilian cabinet is supervised by a National Security Council which is dominated by military officers. After passing this law, elections were held to the national and provincial assemblies. So Pakistan has had elections, elected representatives have some powers. But the final power rested with military officers and General Musharraf himself. Clearly, there are many reasons why Pakistan under General Musharraf should not be called a democracy.

"An essential condition for a democracy to function properly is active political participation by all citizens. This means that every citizen should have one vote, and every vote should have equal value. This is what distinguishes democracy from other forms of government, as non-democratic governments do not require active participation from their citizens. The importance of this condition is highlighted in the passage, which states that ""the fate of the country depends not just on what the rulers do, but mainly on what we, as citizens, do."" This emphasizes the idea that democracy relies on the involvement and engagement of its citizens to function effectively."," An essential condition for a democracy to function properly is active political participation by all citizens.

Democracies need elections to ensure this active participation, as non-democratic countries do not require their citizens to take part in politics. The outcomes of democracy include quality government, economic well-being, inequality reduction, social cohesion, conflict resolution, and freedom and dignity.

"Transparency is important in a democracy because it allows for accountability, public participation, and better decision-making. Non-democratic rulers do not have to worry about deliberation or majorities and public opinion, which means they can make decisions quickly and efficiently. However, this can lead to decisions that are not accepted by the people and may face problems. In contrast, democratic governments take more time to follow procedures before arriving at a decision, but because they have followed procedures, their decisions are both more acceptable to the people and more effective. Additionally, democracy ensures that decision-making is based on norms and values, and that rulers have to attend to the needs of the people. Taking time over important decisions also reduces the chances of rash or irresponsible decisions, which improves the quality of decision-making. Finally, democracy provides a method to deal with differences and conflicts by involving many persons in discussions and meetings, which leads to better decision-making.","Transparency is important in a democracy because it ensures that decision-making is based on norms and values, rather than solely on the wishes of the rulers. In a non-democratic government, rulers can make decisions without consulting the people or worrying about their opinions. However, this lack of transparency and accountability can lead to irresponsible and rash decisions that may not be in the best interest of the people. On the other hand, democracy requires that the rulers attend to the needs of the people and make decisions based on consultation and discussion. This process of taking time over important decisions reduces the chances of irresponsible or rash decisions and improves the quality of decision-making by involving many persons in the process. Additionally, democracy provides a method for dealing with differences and conflicts among people, which is essential in any society. In summary, transparency is crucial in a democracy because it promotes accountability, responsible decision-making, and effective conflict resolution.","government.

So, they can be very quick and efficient in decision making and implementation. Democracy is based on the idea of deliberation and negotiation. So, some delay is bound to take place. Does that make democratic government inefficient? Let us think in terms of costs. Imagine a government that may take decisions very fast.

In contrast, the democratic government will take more time to follow procedures before arriving at a decision.

A democracy requires that the rulers have to attend to the needs of the people. A democratic government is a better government because it is a more accountable form of government. There is another reason why democracy should lead to better decisions than any non-democratic government. Democracy is based on consultation and discussion. A democratic decision always involves many persons, discussions and meetings. When a number of people put their heads together, they are able to point out possible mistakes in any decision. This takes time. But there is a big advantage in taking time over important decisions. This reduces the chances of rash or irresponsible decisions.

Similarly, efforts made by the womens movement led the Supreme Court to formulate guidelines in 1997 to protect women against sexual harassment at the workplace and within educational institutions. In the 1980s, for example, womens groups across the country spoke out against dowry deaths  cases of young brides being murdered by their in-laws or husbands, greedy for more dowry.

"A multi-party system is defined as a political system where more than two parties have a reasonable chance of coming to power either on their own strength or in alliance with others. In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a coalition. Examples of multi-party systems include India, the United Kingdom, and other countries with diverse social and geographical divisions. The multiparty system allows for political representation of various interests and opinions, but it can also lead to political instability. Ultimately, the development of a party system is influenced by a country's unique societal, historical, and electoral factors, making it difficult to determine which system is superior.",If several parties compete for power and more than two parties have a reasonable chance of coming to power either on their own strength or in alliance with others we call it a multi-party system.,"three parties.

Thus in India, we have a multiparty system. In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a coalition. When several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front. For example, in India there were three such major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections– the National Democratic Alliance, the United Progressive Alliance and the Left Front. The multiparty system often appears very messy and leads to political instability. At the same time, this system allows a variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.

"Independent institutions are important in democracy as they provide a check on the power of the ruling authority, ensuring that power is distributed among different organs of government and that none can exercise unlimited power. These institutions, such as the legislature, executive, and judiciary, play a key role in major decisions and disputes are resolved through their functioning. They are connected to other institutions and their functioning is more or less democratic depending on the context. While dealing with these institutions can be frustrating due to rules and regulations, delays, and complications, they provide an opportunity for a wider set of people to be consulted in any decision, making it more democratic. Additionally, power sharing arrangements among different organs of government can take many forms, such as horizontal distribution of power, where different organs exercise different powers, resulting in a balance of power among various institutions.","Independent institutions are important in democracy because they provide a framework for decision-making and ensure that power is distributed fairly and accountably.

"An autocracy is a system of government where one person holds absolute power and control over the state and its citizens. In an autocracy, there are no checks or balances on the leader's power, and they have complete control over the government and its policies. The leader is not accountable to any other branch of government or to the public, and their decisions are final and absolute. Examples of autocratic governments include those found in Latin America and the former Soviet Union. In contrast, a democracy is a system of government where power is shared among different branches of government, and the leader is accountable to the people and must share power with other branches.",Autocracy is a form of government in which one person possesses unlimited power or supreme authority over the government and its people.," Evolution: Process of development from a simple to a complex form and is often used to discuss the development of a species of plants or animals.

" Democracy prevents abuse of power by sharing power among different groups or individuals, ensuring that no single entity has too much control. This is achieved through the consent of all those who are affected by the decision, regardless of their level of power. In a democratic system, everyone has an equal say in decision-making, which helps prevent any one person or group from abusing their power. Additionally, democracy promotes stability and unity by ensuring that the majority community's will is not imposed over others without their consent. Instead, power is shared among different groups, resulting in better outcomes for everyone involved.","In a democracy, the citizens must have freedom to choose among various contenders for power.

It was felt that if the power to decide is dispersed, it would not be possible to take quick decisions and to enforce them. But these notions have changed with the emergence of democracy. One basic principle of democracy is that people are the source of all political power. In a democracy, people rule themselves through institutions of self-government.

"A secular state is one that separates religion from the state and does not favor or promote any particular religion over others. In other words, it does not establish any religion as the official religion of the state, nor does it discriminate against any religious group. The Indian Constitution mandates that the Indian State be secular, which means ensuring that no one religious community dominates another, and that the state does not enforce or promote any particular religion. This is important for a democratic country to prevent tyranny of the majority, where the majority religious group could discriminate against and persecute minority groups. Indian secularism differs from other democratic countries in that it provides financial aid to educational institutions on a non-preferential basis, which means that no particular religion is given preference.","A secular state is defined as one that separates religion from its power and does not promote or enforce any particular religion.

Why is it Important to Separate Religion from the State? As discussed above, the most important aspect of secularism is its separation of religion from State power. This is important for a country to function democratically. Almost all countries of the world will have more than one religious group living in them. Within these religious groups, there will most likely be one group that is in a majority. If this majority religious group has access to State power, then it could quite easily use this power and financial resources to discriminate against and persecute persons of other religions. This tyranny of the majority could result in the discrimination, coercion and at times even the killing of religious minorities.
